# Improved-Arrhythmia-Classification-Using-Select-Morphological-and-Heart-Rate-Variability-ECG-Feature
Final Project Thesis in partial fulfilment of the degree of MSc Big Data Science at the Queen Mary University of London. In this paper, several ML techniques will be employed to produce a model pipeline that takes an electrocardiogram signal (ECG) input signal vector, and correctly classifies individually identified heartbeats as normal, or one of several classes of arrhythmia. The classifications produced by the model should identify cases where ICD intervention is appropriate. 

## This project is split into three jupyter notebook files;

1. `ProjectConceptExploration.ipynb`
This notebook explores the various components and techniques used throughout the design of the model pipeline.

2. `ProjectExtractionaAndPreprocessing.ipynb`
This notebook performs the extraction and data preprocessing steps required for the pipeline input data.

3. `ProjectExperimentsAndPipeline.ipynb`
This notebook constructs the pipeline, and experiments on the best ML technique, feature extraction and classification methods for the pipeline.
